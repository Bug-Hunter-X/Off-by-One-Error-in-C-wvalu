This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error. The error occurs when iterating through an array. The loop condition is not inclusive of the last element of the array causing it to miss the last element in the array. The solution file provides a corrected version of the code that addresses this issue. The bug is demonstrated through a simple array traversal that fails to include the last element.
